# Hi There 

... and welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm a PhD student at [Šarić Lab](https://andelasaric.com/) at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria](https://ista.ac.at/) where I work on bacterial cell division.
I have a background in physics, but have worked on a range of projects involving theoretical materials science, data science and machine learning.
